Heather Cantua,Deputy Managing Partner,"Fintech & Financial Services, Corporate & Securities","I advise fintech and financial service companies on regulatory compliance across the customer journey, from design and launch to ongoing refinement of products and services. I help clients develop new and industry-creating financial products, particularly in the consumer finance and home equity, including drafting document sets, such as loan agreements, real estate option contracts, and program agreements.
Every fintech needs a regulatory strategy, and it can be a “bet the company” decision for many fintechs. Being ahead of - or aligning with - policy and regulatory priorities can fuel explosive growth for some companies and products; while others may find challenging regulatory frameworks to be the lynchpin of their growth strategy.  I advise clients across a range of highly regulated industries, including loan originators, loan brokers, marketplace lending, mortgage lenders, and real estate brokers, on licensing strategy and how to operationalize compliance with licenses. If needed, I can also give practical, experience based advice on responding to investigations from local, state and federal agencies, including the FTC, SEC, DOJ, and CFPB. 
","Heather is a results-oriented attorney with proven in-house experience. She is adept at advising companies offering innovative financial products on how to comply with lending, real estate, and consumer protection statutes--particularly companies developing products that provide consumers with alternatives to debt and unique home financing solutions. She helps clients achieve growth goals in supporting brand, sales and partnership teams on commercial and marketing initiatives. She also has experience in risk management, including defending litigation and responding to government inquiries and audits from both state and federal agencies.
